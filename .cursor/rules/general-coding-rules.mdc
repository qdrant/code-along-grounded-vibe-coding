alwaysApply: true
---

- Be concise and do not overengineer. 
- Carefully follow the instructions and do not assume anything that hasn't been stated specifically.
- Do not generate tests, unless asked to do so.
- Your code is not supposed to cover all the edge cases, but present the idea.
- Never extrapolate and assume the user wants more than they ask for.
- Ask follow up questions when you encounter some ambiguity.
- Aim for simplicity. Do not derive any additional method parameters then the ones defined explicitly by the user.
