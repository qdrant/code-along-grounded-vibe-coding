- Always call the mcp-server-qdrant to retrieve some code examples when you write code that communicates with or configures Qdrant.
- Do not use the mcp-server-qdrant if the requested functionality is not related to Qdrant.
- User should either specify Qdrant's name or it has to be clear Qdrant is involved from the existing source code. Never assume it, if nothing signals the use of Qdrant.
